# About this project

Ikigai is a Discord bot that I created out of my passion for learning Python and my motivation to help gamers find teammates to play with. I noticed that many people are searching for others to play with, but it can be difficult to find the right match. This is where Ikigai comes in - it allows users to create profiles with their gaming preferences and interests, and matches them with other users who have similar profiles. It is simple and effective. Through the process of creating Ikigai, I gained valuable experience in programming and database management, particularly with Mongo DB and the discord.py library. I am excited to continue working on this project and hope that it can make a difference for gamers looking for their ideal teammates.
